# Arduino Data Monitor
 
Designed and implemented an Arduino-based Data Monitor system that receives data values over the Serial Interface in a series of channels, with each data value associated with a channel ID. The system includes an interface via the buttons to examine the most recent values and sets the backlight to a specific colour if the input numbers on any channel fall outside their range. The project also includes a synchronization phase and a main phase with a specific protocol for communication over the serial interface.
